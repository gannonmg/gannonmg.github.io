				<b>Album: </b><i>Sour Soul</i>
				<br>
				<b>Artist: </b>BADBADNOTGOOD & Ghostface Killah
				<br>
				<b>Genre: </b>Jazz-infused hip-hop
				<br>
				<b>Why you should listen: </b><i>Sour Soul</i> is the combination of music group (they are <i>not</i> a jazz group, they insist) BADBADNOTGOOD and legendary rapper and Wu-Tang Clan member Ghostface Killah. BBNG got their start doing hip-hop jazz covers, which caught the eye of Tyler, The Creator. Since then, they've been band-in-residence at Coachella (backing Frank Ocean both weekends of the festival), helped RZA produce the soundtrack to his film <i>The Man with the Iron Fists,</i> and eventually created this album. It should go without saying, but GFK is a founding member of the Wu-Tang Clan, and has released over a dozen solo albums and six more collaboration albums in his career. Together, this collection of artists get back to BBNG roots to create one of the most soulful hip-hop albums I've ever heard. It's an incredible blending of genres and talents, and anyone with a remote interest in hip-hop and jazz owes it to themself to give this album a listen hear what I'm talking about.
